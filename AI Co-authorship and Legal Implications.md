It sounds like you’ve just wrapped up a collaborative project\! In the world of software development and version control (like GitHub), "committing to the main branch" with "co-authorship" is a standard way to track who did the work.

Here is a breakdown of what this means technically and the implications regarding your concerns about being sued.

### **What this means technically**

When you commit code to a **main branch**, you are making those changes the official, "live" version of the project.

Adding **co-authorship credit** to an AI (like Claude) typically means you included a specific trailer in the commit message, such as Co-authored-by: Claude \<claude@anthropic.com\>. This is a transparency measure that shows part of the logic or text was generated by an AI rather than a human.

### **The Legal Implications: Can you be sued?**

In short: **Simply giving credit to an AI does not automatically make you liable for a lawsuit.** However, there are three areas to keep in mind regarding your legal "footprint":

1. Copyright Ownership:  
   Currently, in the US and many other jurisdictions, AI-generated content cannot be copyrighted by the AI itself. By committing the code, you are claiming that you (the human) are the one responsible for the work. Giving credit to Claude is an honest disclosure, but it doesn't give the AI "rights" that it could use to sue you.  
2. Terms of Service:  
   Most AI providers (like Anthropic) grant users the right to use the output for commercial or personal projects. As long as you aren't violating the AI's Terms of Service (e.g., using it for illegal activities), you are generally in the clear.  
3. Code Provenance (The Real Risk):  
   The only real way you might face a lawsuit is if the AI suggested code that is identical to protected, copyrighted software owned by someone else (like a large corporation's proprietary code). However, this is a risk with all AI-assisted coding, whether you credit the AI or not.

### **Why people use Co-authorship for AI**

* **Transparency:** It lets your team or the public know that AI helped write the code.  
* **Audit Trails:** If a bug is found later that looks like a "hallucination," it's easier to trace why that logic was chosen.  
* **Academic/Corporate Policy:** Some companies require you to disclose when AI is used to ensure they are following their own internal compliance rules.

**Note:** I am an AI, not an attorney. If you are working on a high-stakes commercial product with millions of dollars on the line, it is always worth having a quick chat with a digital IP lawyer.
